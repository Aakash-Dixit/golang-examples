# Golang Examples

The Golang examples repository includes utility Golang program examples that can be actively used in the development of various applications with Golang. The programs include commonly used clients for popular cloud-native tools, databases, and programs for RESTful web services. Programs for popular serialization formats, and basic data structures, and sorting examples are also added. The programs also cover a ready-to-use logging service and quite a few useful miscellaneous programs. A short description of the programs is listed next.

- ***ds_algo :***
Includes Golang implementation for basic data structures like Linked List, Stack, Queue, and commonly used sorting algorithms.

- ***etcd :***
Implementation of etcd client with Golang, and basic get, put, delete and watch operations for etcd keys.

- ***http_rest :***
Implementation of HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2/H2C REST server and client with Golang. The uploaded TLS certificates and keys are empty and can be generated when required. Examples for JWT generation and validation are also included. 

- ***json_features :***
Includes Golang examples for commonly used JSON operations such as marshal, unmarshal, and for generating and applying JSON patches.

- ***kafka_sarama :***
Golang implementation for Kafka topic creation, and Kafka consumer and Kafka producer clients, all with Sarama Golang library for Kafka.

- ***kubernetes :***
Includes examples for Kubernetes client with Golang, and basic get, list, and delete operations for pods.

- ***logging :***
Implements both console and file logging examples with Zerolog and Lumberjack libraries.

- ***miscellaneous :***
Includes miscellaneous examples in Golang for creating, reading, and writing files, reading from standard input, parsing XML, etc.

- ***nats :***
Includes example for Golang client for NATS messaging system. Implements NATS publisher, requester, subscriber, sync subscriber, queue subscriber, and replier for the created client. NATS messages are serialized using protocol buffers.

- ***postgres_test :***
Includes example for Golang client for PostgreSQL database. Creating database session, creating and deleting tables, and basic insert, delete, update and select operations.

- ***prometheus_metrics :***
Implements client for Prometheus in Golang and generates test counter, gauge, and histogram. 

- ***protobuf :***
Implements example in Golang for serializing data with Protocol Buffers. Defines a proto file and generates the corresponding Golang code with protoc-gen-go, which is then used for serializing data.
